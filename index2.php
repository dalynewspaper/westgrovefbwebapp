                <p class="glow"> For a great night out and something a little more contemporary, The Oak Bar is a truly elegant space but with both warmth and character. Here we specialise in international beers, divine cocktails and great bar food and provide weekly entertainment to add to the already buzzing atmosphere.
                    <br>The Assaggio Restaurant provides the perfect dining solution throughout the day. Serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, its casual setting adapts perfectly to each. Through a mixture of walnut wood and natural limestone, a warm and relaxed atmosphere is created. The A La Carte menu caters for a variety of tastes from the old family favourites to the more adventurous with each dish having been designed by our Executive Chef John and his creative Team.
